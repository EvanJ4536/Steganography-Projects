# Steganography-Projects
Steganographys main purpose is to hide data within other data such that the hidden data cannot be detected even if it is being sought.  
<br/>
The goal of steganography is:  
**1. Security** - The hidden data should remain undetectable.  
**2. Capacity** – Maximize the amount of data that can be hidden.  
**3. Robustness** – Ensure the hidden data survives transformations or degradation.
